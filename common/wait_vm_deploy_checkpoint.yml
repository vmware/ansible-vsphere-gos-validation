# Wait for a checkpoint in VM's log file. If fail, collect information from
# VM screenshot and log file
# Parameters:
#   wait_checkpoint_name: The checkpoint name, which could be: secureboot,
#     autoinstall_start, autoinstall_complete
#   wait_checkpoint_log_file: The log file name to wait for the checkpoint,
#     e.g. vmware.log or serial port file log
#   wait_checkpoint_msg: The checkpoint message to wait in log file
#     which could be vmware.log or serial port file
#   wait_checkpoint_retires: Retry count for waiting the checkpoint
#   wait_checkpoint_delay: The delay seconds for retry
