# Enable or disable ESXi host firewall rule
# Parameters:
#   rule_name: The firewall rule name on ESXi host.
#   rule_enabled: Whether to enable the firewall rule on ESXi host.
#   rule_allowed_ip(optional): A list of allowed IP addresses.
#   rule_allowed_networks(optional): A list of allowed IP networks.
#   rule_allowed_all(optional): Whether to allow all hosts. If rule_allowed_ip and rule_allowed_networks
#     is not set, it will be set to true by default.
