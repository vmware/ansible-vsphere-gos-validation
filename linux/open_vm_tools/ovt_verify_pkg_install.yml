# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools installation with guest OS package manager.
# If guest OS doesn't have open-vm-tools, this case will install open-vm-tools from OS ISO image
# (e.g. RHEL, SLES, SLED, etc),or install from official online repository (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian,
# VMware Photon OS, CentOS, etc).
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed from package, and parameter "update_vmtools" is set "true"
# in vars/test.yml, it will reinstall open-vm-tools.
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed by other method (like building from source), this
# test case will be skipped with result "Not Applicable" because of unknown uninstall method.
