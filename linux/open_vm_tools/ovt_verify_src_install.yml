# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools installation by building source.
# If guest OS doesn't have open-vm-tools, this case will install open-vm-tools by building source.
# The source tarball can be downloaded from URL defined in linux_ovt_tarball_url.
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed and update_tools parameter is set True in vars/test.yml,
# it will reinstall open-vm-tools.
