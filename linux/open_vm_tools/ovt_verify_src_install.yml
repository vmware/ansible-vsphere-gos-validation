# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools installation by building source.
# If guest OS doesn't have open-vm-tools, this case will install open-vm-tools by building source.
# The source tarball can be downloaded from URL defined in linux_ovt_tarball_url.
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed from package and "update_tools" variable is set "true"
# in vars/test.yml, it will reinstall open-vm-tools.
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed by other method (like building from source), this
# test case will be skipped with result "Not Applicable" because of unknown uninstall method.
