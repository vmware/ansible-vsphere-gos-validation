# Description:
#   This test case is to test open-vm-tools can be uninstalled with guest OS
# package manager successfully if its install type is "package".
# After open-vm-tools is uninstalled, VMware Tools status should be not
# installed and not running, vmtoolsd processes should be not running, and
# services should be absent.
# If open-vm-tools install type is not "package", this test case will be skipped
# with result "Not Applicable" because of unknown uninstall method.
