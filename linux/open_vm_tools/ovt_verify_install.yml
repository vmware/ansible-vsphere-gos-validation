# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools installation.
# If VM doesn't install open-vm-tools, this case will install open-vm-tools from OS ISO image (RHEL/SLES/SLED)
# or official online repository (Ubuntu/Debian/VMware Photon OS/CentOS/RockyLinux/OracleLinux/ProLinux).
# If it already has open-vm-tools installed and update_tools parameter is set True in vars/test.yml,
# it will reinstall open-vm-tools. And then check the install or reinstall output.
