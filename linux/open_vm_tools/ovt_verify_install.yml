# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools installation. If VM doesn't install open-vm-tools, this case will install open-vm-tools from
# OS ISO image (RHEL/SLES/SLED) or official online repository (Ubuntu/Photon OS/CentOS/RockyLinux/OracleLinux). Or if it already has open-vm-tools
# installed and updat_tools is set True in vars/test.yml, it will reinstall open-vm-tools. And then check the install or reinstall output.
