# Description:
#   This test case is to verify open-vm-tools packages, processes, and service
# status in guest OS when open-vm-tools install type is "package". 
# The VMware Tools status should be installed and running, open-vm-tools packages
# should be installed, vmtoolsd processes should be running and service should
# be enabled and running.
# If open-vm-tools install type is not "package", this test case will be skipped
# with result "Not Applicable".
# If VMware Tools status is not installed or not running, this test case result
# will be "Blocked".
