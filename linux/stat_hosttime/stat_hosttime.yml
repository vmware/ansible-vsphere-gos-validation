# Description:
#   This test case is used for check 'vmware-toolbox-cmd' command can display
# the date and time on the host. If VMware Tools is not installed or not running,
# then this test case result will be "Blocked".
# Note: The difference between host time got from 'vmware-toolbox-cmd' in VM and
# the host time got from ESXi host may not in 15s due to network issue.
