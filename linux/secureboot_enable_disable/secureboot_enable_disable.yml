# Description:
#   This test case is used for check VM secure boot can be enabled
# and disabled successfully when VM firmware is UEFI and VM hardware
# version >= 13.
# Note: This test case will not check if target guest OS supports
# secure boot before enable it, please refer to VMware KB article for
# secure boot support matrix.
