# Description:
#   This test case is used for check VM memory hot-add works as expected. When calculated
# memory hot-add size list from free memory size on ESXi server and the configured
# maximum memory size (default 16384MB) is empty, or the free memory size on ESXi server
# is lower than 4096MB, this test case result is 'Blocked'.
# Note: Linux VM memory size will be set to 2048MB before hotadd test.
