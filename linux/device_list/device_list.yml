# Description:
#   This test case is used for check VM device status is reported
# correctly by VMware tools. Enable device list by adding below
# lines into vmx file:
#   isolation.device.connectable.disable = "FALSE"
#   isolation.device.edit.disable = "FALSE"
# If VMware Tools is not installed or not running, then this test
# case result will be "No Run".
