# Install WSL and distribution
#
# Due to known issue for store version of WSL(https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/9231),
# "Launching WSL from session zero does not currently work (for example from an ssh connection)",
# and the support of inbox version is removed from Windows build 25267, the test case will install inbox version for
# build lower than 25267 until the known issue is resolved.
