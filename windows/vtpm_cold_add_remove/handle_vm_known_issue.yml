# There are 2 known issues:
# 1.For Windows Server 2019/2022 VMs with SCSI disk, enabling BitLocker in guest OS returns error:
# "Set-BitLockerVolumeInternal : A device attached to the system is not functioning.
# (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007001F)".
# 2.For Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2025, Bitlocker operations are slow or even may fail in guest
# OS when VM with snapshot.
# Here is the workaround for such issues.
