# Description:
#   This test case is used for test VMware Tools installation in Windows guest OS.
# If no VMware Tools installed in guest OS, this test case will install VMware Tools.
# If there is VMware Tools already installed in guest OS:
# (1) by default 'update_vmtools' will be set to true, this test case will uninstall
# existing VMware Tools firstly, then install VMware Tools when VMware Tools ISO source
# parameters are configured correctly,
# (2) if 'update_vmtools' is set to false, this test case will be skipped when VMware Tools
# service is running, or test case will fail when VMware Tools service is not running.
