# Description:
#   This test case is used for check hotadd, hot remove disk
# on a new and existing NVMe controller with NVMe Spec 1.3 enabled
# manually.
# Notes:
#   Please refer to the release notes of ESXi 8.0.2:

# Default NVMe version 1.3 for Windows virtual machines:
# Starting with vSphere 8.0 Update 2, the NVMe version is set to 1.3 by default for
# Windows Server 2022 or Windows 11 and later VMs with hardware version 21 and later.
# Set this test case result to "Not Applicable" in above situation.
