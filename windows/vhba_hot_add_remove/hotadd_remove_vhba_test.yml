# This file is used to hotadd and hot remove disk controller and disk of VM.
# Disk controller types notes:
# - paravirtual: require pvscsi driver installed or VMware tools installed.
# - lsilogicsas: the default disk controller type of VM.
# - lsilogic: no inbox driver in Windows guest OS now, so no testing.
# - nvme: use the version of community.vmware collection which contains this controller type support.
# - sata: use the version of community.vmware collection which contains this controller type support.
# - buslogic: not supported in 64bit Windows guest OS, no testing.
