# Hot add or hot remove NVMe disk to existing controller,
# this disk change does not take effect before guest OS restart
# or disable/enable NVMe controller.
# Note:
#   Disable/enable operation prompts to request OS restart due to NVMe
# controller disable request is vetoed by storage after OS restart.
# So the workaround here is changed to restart guest OS directly.
