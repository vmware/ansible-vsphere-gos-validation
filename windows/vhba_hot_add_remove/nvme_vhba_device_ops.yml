# Description:
#   This test case is used for check hotadd, hot remove disk
# on NVMe controller.
#   Note: after disk hotadd, need disable and re-enable NVMe
# device in guest OS to recognize the new disk, after disk hot
# remove, need to restart guest OS to take effort. So this test
# case will fail at the validation of disk remove.
