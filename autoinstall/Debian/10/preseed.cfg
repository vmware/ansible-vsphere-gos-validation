#_preseed_V1
#### Contents of the preconfiguration file (for bullseye)
### Localization
# Preseeding only locale sets language, country and locale.
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US.UTF-8

# The values can also be preseeded individually for greater flexibility.
d-i debian-installer/language string en
d-i debian-installer/country string US

# Use the following option to add additional boot parameters for the
# installed system (if supported by the bootloader installer).
# Note: options passed to the installer will be added automatically.
# d-i debian-installer/add-kernel-opts string consoleblank=0

# Optionally specify additional locales to be generated.
d-i localechooser/supported-locales multiselect en_US.UTF-8

# Keyboard selection.
d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select us
d-i keyboard-configuration/variant select English (US)

### Network configuration
# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
d-i netcfg/use_dhcp string true

# To set a different link detection timeout (default is 3 seconds).
# Values are interpreted as seconds.
d-i netcfg/link_wait_timeout string 10

# If you have a slow dhcp server and the installer times out waiting for
# it, this might be useful.
d-i netcfg/dhcp_timeout string 60
#d-i netcfg/dhcpv6_timeout string 60

# If you want the preconfiguration file to work on systems both with and
# without a dhcp server, uncomment these lines and the static network
# configuration below.
d-i netcfg/dhcp_failed note

# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string debian-hostname
d-i netcfg/get_domain string debian-domain

# Disable that annoying WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string

#d-i mirror/http/hostname string deb.debian.org
#d-i mirror/http/mirror select deb.debian.org
#d-i mirror/no-default boolean true
#d-i mirror/protocol select http
#d-i mirror/http/proxy string

### Account setup
# Root password encrypted using a crypt(3)  hash.
d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password {{ vm_password_hash }}
d-i passwd/root-login boolean true

{% if new_user is defined and new_user != 'root' %}
# To create a normal user account.

### Clock and time zone setup
# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# You may set this to any valid setting for $TZ; see the contents of
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values.
d-i time/zone string US/Eastern

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true
# NTP server to use. The default is almost always fine here.
#d-i clock-setup/ntp-server string ntp.example.com
d-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean false

### Partitioning
## Partitioning example
# Specify a disk to partition.
# For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk:
d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/{{ boot_disk_name }}
# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are:
# - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture
# - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk
# - crypto:  use LVM within an encrypted partition
d-i partman-auto/method string lvm

# You can define the amount of space that will be used for the LVM volume
# group. It can either be a size with its unit (eg. 20 GB), a percentage of
# free space or the 'max' keyword.
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:
d-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

# You can choose one of the three predefined partitioning recipes:
# - atomic: all files in one partition
# - home:   separate /home partition
# - multi:  separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic

# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation, provided
# that you told it what to do using one of the methods above.
d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

# Force UEFI booting ('BIOS compatibility' will be lost). Default: false.
{% if firmware is defined and firmware == 'efi' %}
d-i partman-efi/non_efi_system boolean true

# Ensure the partition table is GPT - this is required for EFI
d-i partman-partitioning/choose_label string gpt
d-i partman-partitioning/default_label string gpt
{% endif %}

# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation.
d-i partman-md/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

## Controlling how partitions are mounted
# The default is to mount by UUID, but you can also choose "traditional" to
# use traditional device names, or "label" to try filesystem labels before
# falling back to UUIDs.
#d-i partman/mount_style select uuid

### Apt setup
d-i apt-setup/use_mirror boolean false
d-i apt-setup/cdrom/set-first boolean false
d-i apt-setup/cdrom/set-next boolean false
d-i apt-setup/cdrom/set-failed boolean false
d-i apt-setup/disable-cdrom-entries boolean true

# Don't add any security and updates repo to avoid an upgrade during installation
d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect
d-i apt-setup/enable-source-repositories boolean false

### Package selection
#tasksel tasksel/first multiselect standard, web-server, kde-desktop
tasksel tasksel/first multiselect standard, desktop, gnome-desktop, ssh-server

# Individual additional packages to install
d-i pkgsel/include string build-essential vim locales sg3-utils wget
# There is no open-vm-tools-desktop and cloud-init in CDROM of Debian 10 & 11
# There is no open-vm-tools in CDROM of Debian 12
# These packages will be installed in late_command

# Policy for applying updates. May be "none" (no automatic updates),
# "unattended-upgrades" (install security updates automatically), or
# "landscape" (manage system with Landscape).
d-i pkgsel/update-policy select none

# Some versions of the installer can report back on what software you have
# installed, and what software you use. The default is not to report back,
# but sending reports helps the project determine what software is most
# popular and should be included on the first CD/DVD.
popularity-contest popularity-contest/participate boolean false

### Boot loader installation
# Grub is the boot loader (for x86).

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the UEFI
# partition/boot record if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# Due notably to potential USB sticks, the location of the primary drive can
# not be determined safely in general, so this needs to be specified:
#d-i grub-installer/bootdev string /dev/sda
# To install to the primary device (assuming it is not a USB stick):
d-i grub-installer/bootdev string default

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note

# Shutdown after installation completes
d-i debian-installer/exit/poweroff boolean true

# This will prevent the installer from ejecting the CD during the reboot,
# which is useful in some situations.
#d-i cdrom-detect/eject boolean false

#### Advanced options
### Running custom commands during the installation
# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.
d-i preseed/early_command string \
    echo "Executing early command" >/dev/ttyS0; \
    cp -a /cdrom/{{ pre_install_script_file }} /root/{{ pre_install_script_file }}; \
    /bin/sh /root/{{ pre_install_script_file }} >/dev/ttyS0;

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
d-i preseed/late_command string \
    echo "Executing late command" >/dev/ttyS0; \
    cp -a /cdrom/{{ post_install_script_file }} /target/root/{{ post_install_script_file }}; \
    in-target /bin/bash /root/{{ post_install_script_file }}; \
    echo "Dump installer log:"; \
    cat /var/log/syslog >/dev/ttyS0; \
    echo "{{ autoinstall_complete_msg }}" >/dev/ttyS0;
